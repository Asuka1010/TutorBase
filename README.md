üß† Science of Learning Integration (SoL)
TutorBase applies evidence-based cognitive science to personalize learning plans. It draws on foundational principles of memory and learning to generate and verify syllabi, lesson plans, and assessments using Science of Learning (Kosslyn, 2017; Larsen, 2018; Tabibian, 2019).

‚úÖ Core Learning Principles Embedded in AI Output

Principle	Implementation in TutorBase
Spaced Repetition	Concepts and skills are revisited across time in the syllabus and lesson plans.
Active Recall	Lessons include quiz prompts, retrieval questions, and generative exercises.
Chunking	Topics are broken into digestible sub-units across weeks.
Dual Coding	AI suggests visual explanations alongside text (e.g., diagrams, flowcharts).
Retrieval-Based Learning	Lessons and assessments include self-test tasks, flashcards, and weekly reviews.
üîç Verification Pipeline Using RAG
TutorBase uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework to ensure all outputs align with SoL best practices:

Document Embedding:
We embed research-based documents (e.g., Kosslyn‚Äôs 16 learning principles, Tabibian‚Äôs spaced repetition model) into a vector database.

Contextual Prompting:
When generating a syllabus, lesson, or assessment, the system retrieves relevant pedagogical strategies and best practices as prompt context.

Post-Generation Verification:
After content generation, the system verifies outputs using rule-based and prompt-based checks:

Are key concepts revisited after delay? (spaced)

Are quizzes or self-tests included? (recall)

Are lessons structured around sub-skills or themes? (chunking)

Are visuals suggested with concepts? (dual coding)

Adaptive Feedback Loop:
Tutor feedback and student performance update future generation logic (e.g., adaptive review scheduling).
