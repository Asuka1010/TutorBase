## 🧠 Science of Learning Integration (SoL)

TutorBase is an AI-assisted tutor support platform that auto-generates personalized syllabi, lesson plans, and assessments using NLP and RAG. It embeds cognitive science principles like spaced repetition, active recall, and dual coding to optimize learning outcomes through adaptive content generation and schema-aligned instructional design.

### ✅ Core Learning Principles Used

| Learning Principle        | Implementation in TutorBase                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spaced Repetition**     | Concepts are revisited over time in lesson plans and assessments.                          |
| **Active Recall**         | Quizzes, retrieval questions, and generative tasks are built into lesson flow.              |
| **Chunking**              | AI breaks down topics into sub-skills and weekly themes.                                    |
| **Dual Coding**           | Lessons incorporate both visual and verbal elements (e.g., diagrams with explanations).     |
| **Retrieval-Based Learning** | Weekly lessons include flashcards, self-testing, and cumulative review tasks.            |

### 🔍 RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for SoL Alignment

TutorBase uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** pipeline to align every AI-generated syllabus or lesson with evidence-based learning science.

#### 📥 1. Document Retrieval
- Relevant cognitive science documents (e.g., Kosslyn’s learning principles) are stored in a vector database.
- When a tutor requests a plan, the system retrieves matching strategies and guidelines based on the student’s context.

#### 🧠 2. Prompt Augmentation
- Retrieved documents are injected into the AI prompt.
- Prompts guide the AI to build plans using SoL techniques such as spaced repetition or dual coding.

#### ✔ 3. Post-Generation Verification
Each output is verified for:
- ✅ Revisit timing for spaced repetition
- ✅ Presence of retrieval-based activities (e.g., quizzes)
- ✅ Chunked structure for scaffolding complex concepts
- ✅ Suggestions for visual aids or multi-modal content

#### 🔄 4. Adaptive Feedback
- Tutor feedback and performance data guide future plans.
- Adaptive review scheduling follows memory decay models (e.g., Tabibian et al., 2019).
