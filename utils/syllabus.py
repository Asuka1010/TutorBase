You are an expert teacher and curriculum designer.

Please create a personalized curriculum syllabus for student on the subject of:  
{section.theme}

- Number of Sessions:  {section.number_of_lessons}  
- Session Length:  {section.length_of_session} minutes
- Subject/Discipline: {section.subject}
- Frameworks to include: {section.frameworks}
- Goals for the course: {section.goals}
- Level: {section.level}
- Student Characteristics: {section.student_characteristics}

Here is the student's information:
"""

        for i, student in enumerate(section.students.all(), start=1):
            prompt += f"""
Student {i}:
- Goal & Expectations for Students:  {student.goals or "Not provided"}

- Current Grade/Level in Subject:  {student.current_grades or "Not provided"}

- Identified Weak Areas:  {student.weak_areas or "Not provided"}

- Student Demographics (age, language, personality):  
  - Language: {student.language or "Unknown"}
  - Country: {student.country or "Unknown"}
  - Personality: {student.personality or "Not provided"}

"""
        prompt += """
### Your Task:

1. Analyze the weak areas and break them down into key sub-skills or components.  
   *(e.g., reading â†’ vocabulary, comprehension, grammar)*

2. Generate SMART Learning Objectives for each sub-skill.

3. Structure a long-term curriculum across the teaching period into a overall roadmap, with clear themes or focus areas.  
   *(e.g., Session 1: Vocabulary Mastery)*

4. For each session:
   - Provide a breakdown of topics
   - Outline core strategies and skills
   - List the KEY CONCEPTS to cover

---

### Constraints:

- Personalize to the student's background and level.
- Prioritize remediation of weak areas before advancing to broader objectives.
- Ensure logical skill progression.
- Assume no prior knowledge unless stated.
- Make it practical and age-appropriate.
